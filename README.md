Widely referred to as the one of the best Lua Scripts for Stand, JinxScript is a feature-rich script designed to take aim at malicious modders with a handful of unique trolling features, a plethora of modder detections (and protections), and so much more! 
Whether its not wanting to be turned into the beast or wanting to launch a player 3000ft in the air, JinxScript can do it.
